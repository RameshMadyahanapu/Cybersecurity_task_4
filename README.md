*Task 4: System Exploitation & Hardening Completion*

I'm excited to share that I've completed Task 4 of the ApexPlanet Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking Internship! This hands-on project focused on penetration testing and defensive strategies within a controlled lab environment using Kali Linux and Metasploitable2.

*Key Takeaways:*

1. *System Exploitation*: Successfully exploited the vsFTPd 2.3.4 backdoor vulnerability in Metasploitable2 using Metasploit Framework, gaining root access and executing system commands.
2. *Password Attacks*: Used Hydra for network brute-forcing and John the Ripper for offline password cracking, highlighting the importance of strong passwords.
3. *System Hardening*: Configured firewall policies using iptables, blocking vulnerable services and implementing rate limiting to prevent port scanning and brute-force attacks.

*Skills Demonstrated:*

- Penetration testing and vulnerability exploitation
- Password cracking and brute-forcing
- System hardening and mitigation strategies
- Use of Metasploit Framework, Hydra, and John the Ripper

This project reinforced the "Kill Chain" methodology and provided valuable hands-on experience in cybersecurity and ethical hacking.
